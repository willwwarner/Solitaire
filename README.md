# Solitaire

(goal)
A Solitaire game designed for the GNOME Desktop Environment with many variations

Right now, an in development app with one solitaire game: Klondike.

To test: compile with meson or Flatpak, using GNOME Builder is best.

TODO (Not really in any order):
 * Make game look nice
 * Make solver work
 * Improve the Game Builder Interface
 * Implement more games
 * Add sounds
 * Add animations
 * Add scoring
 * Add preferences
 * Add more card themes
