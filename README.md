# Solitaire

Goal: A Solitaire game designed for the GNOME Desktop Environment with many variations

Right now, an in development app with one solitaire game: Klondike.

To test: compile with meson or flatpak-builder, using GNOME Builder or Foundry is easiest.

To-Do (Not really in any order):
 * Cleanup
 * Make the app look nice
 * Implement more games
 * Add sounds
 * Add animations
 * Add scoring
 * Add preferences
 * Add more card themes
